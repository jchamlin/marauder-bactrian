	description "The Quantum Slipstream Drive, or Slip Drive for short, combines the ability of the scram drive to jump while moving, but allows ships to travel between systems without a hyperlink connection. A slipstream is a narrowly focused, directed field that is initiated by manipulating the fabric of the space-time continuum at the quantum level. This creates a subspace tunnel, which is projected ahead of the vessel. Once a ship has entered this tunnel, the forces inside propel it at incredible speed."

	description "The Syndicate Dual Proton Turret is a relatively new product designed to compete with Deep Sky's perennially popular laser turrets in the anti-fighter defense market. Though cruder than its competition, the Dual Proton Turret maintains a loyal following among captains dissatisfied with laser weapons' short range."

	description "The Particle Cannon works by accelerating a short burst of particles to near-relativistic speeds. When mounted on a ship that can turn fast enough to keep it trained on approaching ships, it becomes a nearly unbeatable weapon, capable of destroying smaller ships before they can even approach close enough for their comparatively short-ranged weapons to be effective."
